1. **Training and validation data:** You can download the official Tidy-X dataset (train + validation) from the [Dataset Download]({{ site.baseurl }}/2_dataset_download/) page. Only this partition from Mozilla Common Voice may be used.

2. **Evaluation data:** The evaluation set is **not released** before the evaluation phase. Details about the evaluation data (size, languages, format, trial structure) are **confidential**. When the evaluation phase opens (see [Important Dates]({{ site.baseurl }}/5_important_dates)), registered participants will receive instructions on how to access the evaluation set and submit results.

3. **CodaBench:** The link to the TidyLang 2026 challenge on CodaBench will be **announced when the evaluation phase opens**. At that time, you will be able to register for the evaluation and submit results. Please check this website and the Important Dates page for updates. *Coming soon — stay tuned!*

4. **Submission format:** The exact submission format (file names, structure, and content) will be published when the evaluation phase opens. Please read the [Submission Guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/4_submission_guidelines/) for general rules and check back for the final format and any validation scripts.

5. **Privacy:** During the evaluation phase, participants will only see their own results until the release of the final rankings.

6. **Rankings:** After the evaluation phase, we will release the final rankings. To be included, you must submit results according to the instructions published at the opening of the evaluation phase. The announcement will be made as specified in the Submission Guidelines. Participants may share their team code in their papers or with us, and we can feature it on the website.

7. **Deadline:** Key dates are listed on the [Important Dates]({{ site.baseurl }}/5_important_dates) page (e.g., result submission deadline and challenge paper deadline).

Please feel free to contact us if you need any help.

Good luck and enjoy the challenge!
