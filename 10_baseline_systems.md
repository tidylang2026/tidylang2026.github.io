## Baseline Systems

To provide a strong starting point for participants and ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, we will publicly release official baseline systems. These systems represent a range of approaches, from training from scratch on the provided data to fine-tuning large, pre-trained models. The goal is to lower the barrier to entry and allow participants to benchmark their own novel methods against these robust baselines.

The official baseline systems are:
- **ResNet-34 (VB2)**: A powerful model pre-trained on VoxBlink2 (VB2)
- **ResNet-34 (fine-tuned)**: A powerful model pre-trained on VoxBlink2 (VB2) and then fine-tuned on the TidyVoiceX training partition

We will release the complete training recipes (using the WeSpeaker toolkit), evaluation scripts, and the pre-trained checkpoints for each of these models to the public. These systems and their results serve as a robust reference point against which participants can benchmark their own approaches.
