## Baseline Systems

To provide a strong starting point for participants and ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, we will publicly release an official baseline system. This system represents an approach that uses a pre-trained model fine-tuned on the provided data. The goal is to lower the barrier to entry and allow participants to benchmark their own novel methods against this robust baseline.

The official baseline system is:
- **ResNet-34 (fine-tuned)**: A powerful model pre-trained on VoxBlink2 (VB2) and then fine-tuned on the TidyVoiceX training partition

We will release the complete training recipe (using the WeSpeaker toolkit), evaluation scripts, and the pre-trained checkpoint for this model to the public. This system and its results serve as a robust reference point against which participants can benchmark their own approaches.
