#### **1. Are pretrained datasets and pretrained models allowed on the TTS track?**
Yes, the pretrained model and dataset are allowed. But the final model should be finetuned with the TITW at the last phase.

#### **2. Is it allowed to combine multiple independently trained models during inference (e.g., by averaging scores or using stacking) on the TTS track?**
Yes, it’s allowed.

#### **3. Can participants join both tracks?**

Each team can only participate in one track—either TTS or SASV. Participants cannot join both tracks at the same time.
